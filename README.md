# AnimeGo Desktop Player
This is an experimental desktop player for AnimeGo. There are two different versions, C++ and Rust. The C++ version was the original attempt. It works very well on macOS, but it requires additional DLLs on Windows. The Rust version works on both platforms and can run without any additional DLLs. The binary is slightly larger however.

Consider the C++ version as deprecated and use the Rust version instead.
